# KaggleFreezingOfGaitPrediction
A machine learning pipeline that I built to identify Freezing of Gait events in Parkinson's Disease patients (Kaggle Competition).

I tried the following models:
- MLP Neural Network (SciKit Learn)
- LGB
- Logistic Regression
- Keras Neural Network


[Placed 232/1379 (17th percentile)](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/tlvmc-parkinsons-freezing-gait-prediction/leaderboard?search=hinkel)

Open sourcing the code on GitHub in case it may be useful. I will come back to this and explain it (hopefully).
